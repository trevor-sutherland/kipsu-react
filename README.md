## About the App

This App uses React.js to make dynamic messages based on 3 dynamic dropdown forms and one custom message form. <br />

It takes in data from Guests.json, Message.json, and Companies.json to form a card.<br />

A greeting will display based on time of day.<br />

### `npm run deploy`

This is a GitHub specific script to deploy to GitHub pages.<br />
It first builds the app for production to the `build` folder as seen above in 'npm run build'.<br />
A gh-pages branch is created to deploy to a GitHub pages target.<br /> 
Currently, the build folder deploys to [https://trevor-sutherland.github.io/trevor-interview-code-project/](https://trevor-sutherland.github.io/trevor-interview-code-project/).<br />
